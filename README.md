---TICKET VENDOR MACHINE---
This system is an automated ticket-issuing system for public transportation such as buses and trains. 
The system utilizes a Ticket Vendor Machine (TVM) as part of a Smart Ticketing System.

Users are able to select their destination and choose a mode of payment such as Credit Card, QR Code payment linked with banking systems, or a digital wallet.

When a user chooses to pay with a credit card, the TVM issues a paper ticket with a bar code and the user's credit card account is charged. 
To select a destination, the user must press the start button which activates a menu displaying potential destinations. Once a destination is selected, the user is prompted to input their credit card. After the credit transaction has been validated, the ticket is issued.

When a user chooses to pay with a digital wallet, the TVM will display a QR Code after the user has selected their desired route for mobile phone payment.
